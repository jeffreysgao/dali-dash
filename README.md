This app uses [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) for text, dropdown and card components. The card flipping feature comes from the ReactCardFlip component created by [Aaron Wong](https://github.com/AaronCCWong/react-card-flip).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
